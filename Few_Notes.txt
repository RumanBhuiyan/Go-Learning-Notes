Issue no - 01: (one true brace style)
--------------------------------------
func main(){
    fmt.Println("Hello!")
}

This code will work file but

func main()
{
    fmt.Println("Hello!")
}

This code wont work because we don't put semicolon in end of every statement though
go places semicolon by itself at end of every statement. That's why when we code like
above then go will place a semicolon like func main(); and as it is function without
body. Go will throw missing function body error. That's why we can't put opening curly 
braces in a newline. As a result we should follow 'one true brace style' rule in Go.
